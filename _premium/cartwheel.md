<div class="user-html"><p><strong>Cartwheel</strong> is a responsive blog theme for Jekyll built using HTML, Sass, and jQuery with a clean and modern design.</p>

<p>The theme includes a built in section for a personal Instagram feed thatâ€™s ready to go with an easy to get API key (required by Instagram). There are sections for a portfolio, which is built using a slider, and a blog with both archive and tag views.</p>

<p>All aspects of the website are editable like colors easily being switched directly from the _config.yml file instead of having to dig through any code. Documentation is also included with the files.</p>
